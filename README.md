## Purely Functional Data Strutures with Scala Dotty

from the book PFDS (Okasaki 1998)

It does not require any dependencies. Implemented with pure Dotty types.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project, you can compile code with `sbt compile` and run it
with `sbt run`, `sbt console` will start a Dotty REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
